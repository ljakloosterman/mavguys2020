TEST Border Detection
Objective: Find out whether the drone detects the Cyberzoo border in all directions
Tasks: Let the drone fly towards all four sides of the Cyberzoo
Observations: Drone follows commands, at black backgrounds it turns as expected, at backgrounds with nets it does not always detect the border
Results: Investigations have shown that the background has green noise that the drone takes for floor.
Iteration: Image blur was added to reduce background noise.
Iteration2: Image blur was removed again because it didn't show the expected result
