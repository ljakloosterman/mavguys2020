----------TEST PROTOCOL----------

TEST Border Turn Angle
Objective: Find out how far the drone shall turn when reaching a Cyberzoo border
Tasks: Change the horizontal green ratio criteria for border detection (1/3 or 1/4). Add this parameter as a setting. Conduct test flights towards the border.
Observations: When set to 1/4 the drone does not turn far enough, it will still face the border and stop again very soon. When set to 1/3 the drone turns by a sufficient angle and does not face the same border anymore
Results: 1/3 is chosen as the horizontal green ratio criteria for the border detection.
Iteration: None
