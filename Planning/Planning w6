Global planning: (weeks # - #)
- Form groups (week 1)
- Instal paparazzi (week 1-2)
- Try out provided orange module (week 2-3)
- Devise strategy (week 2 - 4)
- Prototype vision algorithms (scirpts/sim) (week 3 - 5)
- Implement control algos in Paparazzi (sim/rael) (week 3 - 6)
- Implement vision algos in Paparazzi (sim/real) (week 4 - 6)
- Test iterate (week 5-7)
- D-day at 26 march (make sure that we hand in github URL before 26 march)
- Hand in report before 31 march



Planning for next weeks:
Vision prototyping is done
Week 6:
- Implement control algos in Paparazzi (sim/rael) (week 3 - 6) (Barry & Prawien)
	- Not really started yet, but must simple be, if something then left or right for #-degrees 
	- Reserve 1 ppl
- Implement vision algos in Paparazzi (sim/real) (week 4 - 6) (Jean-luc, Hakim, Sebastiaan)
	- Very hard part of coding all the vision stuff into C
		- Divide the vision code is small parts and convert that to C via google
	- Make a flow chart of the interaction between the c-files for Paparazzi (Sebastiaan)
	-
	- reserve 4 ppl
- ROC-curve programming in Python to determine quality of each code (t.b.d.)
	- Could be a good way to determine which vision code to choose with varying parameters
	- Is also of value for the report
	- on planning?
	- assigned to ??
- Find out the whole effect of optitrack (Barry & Prawien)
- Understand the 'timer' (Luc)
- Confidence determination (t.b.d.)

Week 7:
- Testing all codes and developing a working principle
- Implementing results from ROC-curve
- 



For control part:
use the abibind sending part from one c file to another, then it is not global and cannot be deleted somewhere else.
use 0, 1, 2 for safe, right, left

questions & progress online meeting 18-03-2020:
- Luc: wasnt able to start on timer so far
- Prawien & Barry: some progress on navigation, now test it more with predetermined variable values to predict and fully understand the navigation
- Sebastiaan:   green detector works partly, but seb needs to gets acces on pixels in paparazzi in c. Lucs joins seb to find out
- Jean luc & Hakim: a new vertical line (90 deg) detector just to influence on a small scale the confidence. Now start to program to c
